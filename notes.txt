FORMIK AND VALIDATION 
 objectives 
        1. leern how to create and validate forms wwith Formik and Yup

validation - is an automatic check to ensure that data enntered is sesnsible and feasable.
form - a HTML form is used to collect user input. 
the user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

FORMIK
formik is a react library that makes working with forms easy for us.


SIGN UP FORMIK

the form will inlcude inout fiels for email and name and age.
under the form there is a table that reflects what is stores in the database.

in SignUp.js file whcih contains the sign up form component.

the formik library provides us a hook to give initial values to the form and write a onSubmit callback fucntion to do something witht he values that were 
submitted.
we can use the onSubmit method to submit send the vlaues and store the values in the database.
to do validation we can define  a validation schema.



VALIDATIONS
for validation we will use the YUP librarby that meshes well with Formik. Yup 
is a schema builder for runtime parsing and validation

yup allows us to instntiate an objetct and define its shape fucniton which takes in an object od the 
fields we want to validate.
we can chaim validation rules to create complec and strict validation rules that allows us to control input and create more robust applications.

Looking at the age schema as an example. we want ot accept a number()
which is positive() and is an integer(). we alsoe want to make sure it is required() yup makes error messafes easy to define.
we can pass the error messafe we ewant to display in the broken rule by apssing a trign into the rule defination like we did here required('Must enter age")

we can access these errors in the JSX by using the formik hooks error attributes <p style={{color:'red'}}> {formik.errors.name}</p>   
in this example we show the validation errors as a red <p> tag.
